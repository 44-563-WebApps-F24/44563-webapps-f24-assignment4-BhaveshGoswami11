        <p><b>OR.</b><br> Say, dames and damsels, have we heard aright,
            And speed we to the goal of our desire?</p>
            <p><b>CH</b><br>And what desire or quest hath brought thee hither?</p>
            <p><b>OR.</b><br>I seek Aegisthus’ dwelling all this while.</p>
            <p><b>CH.</b><br>Welcome. The tongue that told thee hath no blame.</p>
            <p><b>OR.</b><br> Which of you all will signify within
                Our joint arrival,—not unwelcome here.</p>
             <p><b>CH.</b><br>This maiden, if the nearest should report.</p> 
            <p><b>OR.</b><br>Mistress, wilt thou go yonder and make known,
                That certain Phocians on Aegisthus wait?</p> 
                <p><b>EL.</b><br> Oh! can it be that you are come to bring
                    Clear proofs of the sad rumour we have heard?</p>
                <p><b>OR.</b><br>I know not what ye have heard. Old Strophius
                    Charged me with tidings of Orestes’ fate.</p>
                    <p>What, stranger? How this terror steals on me!</p> 
                    <p><b>OR.</b><br>Bearing scant remnants of his body dead
                        In this small vase thou seest, we bring them home.</p>
                        <p><b>EL.</b><br>O sorrow! thou art here: I see full well
                            That burden of my heart in present view.</p> 
                            <p><b>OR.</b><br>If thou hast tears for aught Orestes suffered,
                                Know that he lies within this vessel’s room.</p>
                                <p><b>EL.</b><br> Ah, sir! by all in Heaven, if yonder urn
                                    Hide him, ah! give it once into my hand,
                                    That o’er that dust I may lament and mourn
                                    Myself and mine own house and all our woe!</p>
                                    <p><b>OR.</b><br>Bring it and give her, whosoe’er she be.
                                        For not an enemy—this petition shows it—
                                        But of his friends or kindred, is this maid</p>
