<p><span class="name Orestes">Orestes:</span> <span class="speech"><br> Say, dames and damsels, have we heard aright,<br>
And speed we to the goal of our desire?</span></p>

<p><span class="name Chorous">Chorous:</span> <span class="speech"><br>And what desire or quest hath brought thee hither?</span></p>

<p><span class="name Orestes">Orestes:</span> <span class="speech"><br>I seek Aegisthus’ dwelling all this while.</span></p>

<p><span class="name Chorous">Chorous:</span> <span class="speech"><br>Welcome. The tongue that told thee hath no blame.</span></p>

<p><span class="name Orestes">Orestes:</span> <span class="speech"><br>Which of you all will signify within<br>
Our joint arrival,—not unwelcome here.</span></p>

<p><span class="name Chorous">Chorous:</span> <span class="speech"><br>This maiden, if the nearest should report.</span></p>

<p><span class="name Orestes">Orestes:</span> <span class="speech"><br>Mistress, wilt thou go yonder and make known,<br>
That certain Phocians on Aegisthus wait?</span></p>

<p><span class="name Electra">Electra:</span> <span class="speech"><br>Oh! can it be that you are come to bring<br>
Clear proofs of the sad rumour we have heard?</span></p>

<p><span class="name Orestes">Orestes:</span> <span class="speech"><br>I know not what ye have heard. Old Strophius<br>
Charged me with tidings of Orestes’ fate.</span></p>

<p><span class="name Electra">Electra:</span> <span class="speech"><br>What, stranger? How this terror steals on me!</span></p>

<p><span class="name Orestes">Orestes:</span> <span class="speech"><br>Bearing scant remnants of his body dead<br>
In this small vase thou seest, we bring them home.</span></p>

<p><span class="name Electra">Electra:</span> <span class="speech"><br>O sorrow! thou art here: I see full well<br>
That burden of my heart in present view.</span></p>

<p><span class="name Orestes">Orestes:</span> <span class="speech"><br>If thou hast tears for aught Orestes suffered,<br>
Know that he lies within this vessel’s room.</span></p>

<p><span class="name Electra">Electra:</span> <span class="speech"><br>Ah, sir! by all in Heaven, if yonder urn<br>
Hide him, ah! give it once into my hand,<br>
That o’er that dust I may lament and mourn<br>
Myself and mine own house and all our woe!</span></p>

<p><span class="name Orestes">Orestes:</span> <span class="speech"><br>Bring it and give her, whosoe’er she be.<br>
For not an enemy—this petition shows it—<br>
But of his friends or kindred, is this maid.</span></p>
