        <h1>Bhavesh Goswami presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
        <h2>Electra</h2>
        
        <p class = "direction">[_Enter_CLYTEMNESTRA_.]</p>
        <p><span class="name Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra:</span> <span class="speech"><br>
        <p>CLY. Brazen thing!<br>
        Too true it is that words and deeds of mine<br>
        Are evermore informing thy harsh tongue.</p>
    
        <p><span class="name Electra">Electra:</span> <span class="speech"><br>
        <p>EL. The shame is yours, because the deeds are yours.<br>
        My words are but their issue and effect.</p>
    
        <p><span class="name Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra:</span> <span class="speech"><br>
        <p>CLY. By sovereign Artemis, whom still I serve,<br>
        You’ll rue this boldness when Aegisthus comes.</p>
    
        <p><span class="name Electra">Electra:</span> <span class="speech"><br>
        <p>EL. See now, your anger bears you off, and ne’er<br>
        Will let you listen, though you gave me leave.</p>
    
        <p><span class="name Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra:</span> <span class="speech"><br>
        <p>CLY. Must I not even sacrifice in peace<br>
        From your harsh clamour, when you’ve had your say?</p>
    
        <p><span class="name Electra">Electra:</span> <span class="speech"><br>
        <p>EL. I have done. I check thee not. Go, sacrifice!<br>
        Accuse not me of hindering piety.</p>
    
        <p><span class="name Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra:</span> <span class="speech"><br>
        <p>CLY. (to an attendant).<br>
        Then lift for me those fruitful offerings,<br>
        While to Apollo, before whom we stand,<br>
        I raise my supplication for release<br>
        From doubts and fears that shake my bosom now.</p>
